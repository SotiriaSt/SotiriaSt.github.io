## Welcome

I am an electrical engineer with my main field of expertise being Telecommunications and Computer Networks. I have worked on the telecom support field as RF engineer and also on a personal project as network engineer and I have a great interest for Satellite Communications.

I have a M. Eng. from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), which is one of the most demanding universities for engineers in Greece. Currently I am pursuing a M.Eng in Cybersecurity at the university of Maryland in the US.
